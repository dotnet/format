## CLI options

### Specify a workspace (Required)

A workspace path is needed when running dotnet-format. By default, the current folder will be used as the workspace path. The workspace path and type of workspace determines which code files are considered for formatting.

- Solutions and Projects - By default dotnet-format will open the workspace path as a MSBuild solution or project.
- `--folder` - When the folder options is specified the workspace path will be treated as a folder of code files.

*Example:*

Format the code files used in the format solution.

```console
dotnet-format ./format.sln
```

Format the code files used in the dotnet-format project.

```console
dotnet-format ./src/dotnet-format.csproj
```

Format the code files from the  `./src` folder.

```console
dotnet-format ./src --folder
```

### Running analysis

#### CodeStyle analysis

Running codestyle analysis requires the use of a MSBuild solution or project file as the workspace. Enforces the .NET [Language conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/editorconfig-language-conventions?view=vs-2019) and [Naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/editorconfig-naming-conventions?view=vs-2019).

- `--fix-style <severity>` - Runs analysis and attempts to fix issues with severity equal or greater than specified. If severity is not specified then severity defaults to error.

*Example:*

Run analysis against the format solution and fix errors.

```console
dotnet-format ./format.sln --fix-style
```

Run analysis against the dotnet-format project and fix warnings and errors.

```console
dotnet-format ./src/dotnet-format.csproj --fix-style warning
```

Errors when used with the `--folder` option. Analysis requires a MSBuild solution or project.

```console
dotnet-format ./src --folder --fix-style
```

#### 3rd party analysis

Running 3rd party analysis requires the use of a MSBuild solution or project file as the workspace. 3rd party analyzers are discovered from the `<PackageReferences>` specified in the workspace project files.

- `--fix-analyzers <severity>` - Runs analysis and attempts to fix issues with severity equal or greater than specified. If no severity is specified then this defaults to error.

### Filter files to format

You can further narrow the list of files to be formatted by specifying a list of paths to include or exclude. When specifying folder paths the path must end with a directory separator. File globbing is supported.

- `--include` - A list of relative file or folder paths to include in formatting.
- `--exclude` - A list of relative file or folder paths to exclude from formatting.

*Example:*

Other repos built as part of your project can be included using git submodules. These submodules likely contain their own .editorconfig files that are set as `root = true`. This makes it difficult to validate formatting for your project as formatting mistakes in submodules are treated as errors.

The following command sets the repo folder as the workspace. It then includes the `src` and `tests` folders for formatting. The `submodule-a` folder is excluded from the formatting validation.

```console
dotnet format -f --include ./src/ ./tests/ --exclude ./src/submodule-a/ --check
```

### Logging and Reports

- `--verbosity` - Set the verbosity level. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic]
- `--report` - Writes a json file to the given directory. Defaults to 'format-report.json' if no filename given.

### Validate formatting

- `--check` - Formats files without saving changes to disk. Terminates with a non-zero exit code (`2`) if any files were formatted.
