Going forward, the .NET format team is using the [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk) repository for further development and respond to issues formerly in that repository.

For finding the dotnet format usage, check the [SDK repo](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/tree/main/documentation/format/docs).
